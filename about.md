**Hey there!**

I'm studying Computer Science and Statistics at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu), with a focus on intelligence, modeling and simulation.

I'm also an aspiring data scientist. I love data, and enjoy analyzing it to predict trends and gain insights about the world. Passionate about artificial intelligence and machine learning, I'm always ready to engage in conversations about how these fields are revolutionizing our lives.

In my free time, I enjoy working on projects, going to hackathons and giving talks at meetups. Check out some of my [projects](/projects).

This past summer, I interned at [Vital Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/6466164/), where I worked to improve the prediction and analysis of blood pressure data using sensors in smartphones. I was also a fellow with True Ventures in the [True Entrepreneur Corps](https://trueventures.com/tec/).

This summer, I'm interning as a data scientist at [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com) in the Worldwide Sales Training team. I am currently exploring internship opportunities for Summer 2018.
