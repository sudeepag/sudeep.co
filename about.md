**Hey there!**

I'm studying Computer Science and Statistics at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu), with a focus on intelligence, modeling and simulation.

I'm also an aspiring data scientist. I love data, and enjoy analyzing it to predict trends and gain insights about the world. Passionate about artificial intelligence and machine learning, I'm always ready to engage in conversations about how these fields are revolutionizing our lives.

Some of my experience includes improving the prediction of blood pressure using smartphone sensors at [Vital Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/6466164/), building a regression model that predicts the effectiveness of sales representatives around the world at [Cisco Systems](http://www.cisco.com), and tackling personalization at [Apple News](https://www.apple.com/news/).
