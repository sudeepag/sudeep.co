**Hey there!**

I'm studying Computer Science and Statistics at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu), with a focus on intelligence, modeling and simulation.

I'm also an aspiring data scientist. I love data, and enjoy analyzing it to predict trends and gain insights about the world. Passionate about artificial intelligence and machine learning, I'm always ready to engage in conversations about how these fields are revolutionizing our lives.

In my free time, I enjoy working on projects, going to hackathons and giving talks at meetups. Check out some of my [projects](/projects).

Some of my experience includes working at [Vital Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/6466164/) to improve the prediction of blood pressure using smartphone sensors, being a fellow with True Ventures in the [True Entrepreneur Corps](https://trueventures.com/tec/), and working as a data scientist at [Cisco Systems](http://www.cisco.com) in the Worldwide Sales Training team to build a model that predicts the effectiveness of sales representatives around the world. 

This summer, I am excited to be working at Apple, Inc. in the [Apple News](https://www.apple.com/news/) team.
