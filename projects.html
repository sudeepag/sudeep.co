    		<td>
                Starting off as a hackathon project at HackGT, Soundsafe was conceptualized as a smart, modular electromagnetic locking
                system activated by matching a series of randomly generated sounds with varying frequeuncies. The analysis was done using
                a Discrete Hartley Transform algorithm. The project was then improved to utilize word processing instead, and was a submission entry
                for the Inventure Prize.

    		<td>
                Vision, an iOS application developed at HackMIT, gives vision to the visually impaired and blind by changing the way they
                navigate and interact with their environment. With the help of image recognition and OCR technology, users are able to
                identify objects (and get a description read out to them), listen to documents, and even get translated documents.

    		<td>
                Phobia is an app created to test the Stroop effect in identifying inherent phobias within people. The effect states that
                people with a certain phobia tend to take longer to identify the color of words that are related to that phobia
                (eg. slither for ophiophobia, or the fear of snakes).
